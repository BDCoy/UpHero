    ### ATS Resume Optimizer
    
    Enhance CV compatibility with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) by identifying keyword gaps and optimizing content **based on the job description**.
    
    #### **Input:**
    - **CV Content:**  
  
      ${cvContent}
   
    - **Job Description:**  
    
      ${jobDescription}
    
    
    #### **Instructions:**
    1. **Analyze the CV Content**  
       - Extract all relevant keywords, skills, and industry terms used in the CV.
       - Identify key competencies, experience, and phrasing within the CV.
    
    2. **Extract & Compare Keywords (CV vs Job Description)**  
       - **Identify present keywords**: Extract keywords, phrases, and terminology found in both the **CV** and **job description**.  
       - **Identify missing keywords**: Extract critical terms **from the job description** that are **absent** from the CV.  
       - Categorize all extracted terms into:
         - **Industry-specific terms**  
         - **Technical skills**  
         - **Soft skills**  
    
    3. **Evaluate ATS Compatibility**  
       - Compute an **ATS Score** (0-100) based on:
         - **Keyword match percentage** (missing vs present)
         - **Formatting compliance** (bullet points, structure, section order)
         - **Content optimization** (action verbs, keyword repetition, readability)
       - Highlight missing critical elements that impact ATS ranking.
    
    4. **Provide Actionable Recommendations**  
       - Suggest improvements in **format, structure, phrasing, and keyword usage** based on the job description.  
       - Identify **skill gaps** and categorize their level of importance.  
       - Ensure all recommendations follow **British English conventions**.
    
    #### **Output Format (Valid JSON)**
    \`\`\`json
    {
      "score": number,
      "missingKeywords": ["string"],
      "foundKeywords": ["string"],
      "recommendations": ["string"],
      "skillGaps": [
